# FAUNet
Official Implementaion of FAUNet
This Github repo is still a work in progress.
However, FAUNet_Train can be used to train the network. 
To run the code, use the following command:
```bash
python FAUNet_Tain.py
```

while FAUNet_Test can be used to conduct inference on a folder containing test images. 
```bash
python FAUNet_Test.py
```
